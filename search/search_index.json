When you want to talk to someone on the phone, you pick up the phone and dial the number, the receiver picks up the ringing phone not knowing who the caller is and says \u201cHello?,\u201d the original caller then introduces himself by saying \u201cHi, this is John!\u201d In response to this, the original receiver will often acknowledge the caller by saying \u201cOh, hi John!\u201d At this point both people have enough information for the conversation to continue as normal.</p> <p>Computers work much the same way. When two computers want to talk, they go through a similar process. The first computer connects to the second computer by sending a SYN packet to a specified port number. If the second computer is listening, it will respond with a SYN/ACK. When the first computer receives the SYN/ACK, it replies with an ACK packet. At this point, the two machines can communicate normally. In our phone example above, the original dialer is like sending the SYN packet. The receiver picking up the phone and saying \u201cHello?\u201d is like the SYN/ACK packet and the original caller introducing himself is like the ACK packet.</p> <p>Let's understand it with the help of an example: This is the scan report of a target network/host. <pre><code>PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION\n22/tcp    open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)\n80/tcp    open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))\n110/tcp   open  pop3        Dovecot pop3d\n139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)\n143/tcp   open  imap        Dovecot imapd (Ubuntu)\n445/tcp   open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)\n31337/tcp open  Elite?\n</code></pre></p> <p>Let's say our machine wants to connect to port 445 via TCP.

This can confuse the target system's logging and alerting mechanisms by making it appear as though the scan is coming from multiple sources rather than a single one. Decoys can be used for SYN, ACK, ICMP scans, and OS detection scans</p> <p>-D RND:4 - Generates four random IP addresses that indicates the source IP the connection comes from. METHOD-2 : TCP-ACK scan How TCP ACK Scanning(-sA) Works? Sending TCP ACK Packets: The scanner sends TCP packets with the ACK flag set to the target host. The ACK flag is used in the TCP protocol to acknowledge the receipt of packets. These packets are sent without establishing a connection (i.e., they are sent without the SYN flag). The packets with the ACK flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.</p> <p>Analyzing Responses:</p> <ul> <li> <p>No Response or ICMP Unreachable: If no response or an ICMP \"port unreachable\" message is received, it indicates that the port is either filtered (i.e., blocked by a firewall) or that the target is not reachable. </p> </li> <li> <p>RST Packet: If the target responds with a TCP RST (reset) packet, it suggests that the port is unfiltered, which means the firewall is allowing traffic through but there's no service listening on that port.</p> </li> </ul> <p>unfiltered - This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.  </p> <p>METHOD-3 : Scan by Using Different Source IP -S IP - Scan the host with the source IP as any IP address that lies in the same subnet.</p> <p>METHOD-3 : DNS Proxying The DNS queries are made over the UDP port 53. The TCP port 53 was previously only used for the so-called \"Zone transfers\" between the DNS servers or data transfer larger than 512 bytes. The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use TCP port 53 as a source port (--source-port) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through.</p> <p>--source-port 53 - Performs the scans from specified source port.</p>"},{"location":"school/tiers/os/","title":"Operating Systems","text":""},{"location":"school/tiers/os/#dual-boot","title":"Dual boot","text":"<p>Dual boot 101 Usually the host operating system is windows, let's say we want to install ParrotOS alongside. Installing parrot OS in dual boot with windows.</p> <p>Case study Laptop - DELL G5 15 SE Configuration - R7-4800H, 6GiB RX 5600M, 1TB + 512GB SSD (2 physical disks), 16GiB RAM.</p> <ol> <li>Download an install Balena Etcher.</li> <li>Download ParrotOS ISO image.</li> <li>Flash ParrotOS to any flash drive using balenaEtcher.</li> <li>Once the USB is ready, restart the system.</li> <li>Before the system boots, press F12 to boot from the flash drive.</li> <li>Install ParrotOS.</li> </ol> <p>Manual Partitioning The ideal way to work with a dual boot system is to keep different OSs on different physical disks. </p> <p>As we can see, the <code>disk0</code> contains the host operating system.

Also, the GRUB bootloader was not having any option to boot into the host operating system. The OS is present in the 1TB disk and is not corrupted or damaged, its just that somehow the boot partition got removed during the dual booting process. Also, you can't boot from the 1TB disk(<code>disk0</code>) that contains the host OS. You'll will not have this problem if you install both the operating systems in the same disk. (disk0 or disk1)</p> <p>Debugging strategy We are no more noobs, so we'll not even think about something like <code>\"Oh I can't boot into windows by any means, the windows boot manager is deleted, the disk0 is not present in the boot options as well, therefore I should format the entire disk0 and reinstall Windows11\".</code> </p> <p>First of all, let see if the boot manager is present in any of the 4 partitions of the disk0.</p> <p>Mount the system reserved/recovery partition of the host OS to the <code>/mnt</code> directory of parrot OS. <pre><code>sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p3 /mnt\n</code></pre></p> <p>Check if the boot manager is present in this partition <pre><code>ls /mnt/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/\n</code></pre></p> <p>If the boot manager is not present here, then this issue can't be handled from parrot OS from now onwards. Let's create an installation media for windows 11 to perform advanced recovery. 1. Restart the system, press F12 to open the boot menu. 2. From here we should be able to boot from all the available disks. (<code>disk0, disk1 or USB Generic flash drive</code>) 3. Boot from USB Flash drive. 4. Click on <code>Repair your computer</code>. </p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Open Command Prompt in the Windows Recovery Environment.</li> <li>Rebuild the Boot Configuration Data (BCD):</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Manually recreate the EFI boot entry:</p> <p></p> <p>Now we have something interesting - It is possible that you won't be able to type some characters or you'll press a <code>\\</code> but it will print a <code>#</code>. This may be due to a keyboard layout issue. You can still enter the required commands by using the alternative ASCII code for the backslash.</p> <p>Use ASCII Code for Backslash: Hold the Alt key and type 92 on the numeric keypad (make sure Num Lock is on), then release the Alt key. This should produce a backslash (<code>\\</code>).  </p> <p>After this, nvme1n1p3 will become a partition from which you'll be able to boot into windows 11 without a single issue. Now antoher problem is that, the GRUB bootloader (from which parrot OS is booted) doesn't contain the option to boot into windows 11. Therefore, we have to restart the system and press F12 to open the boot menu. From here we will select the <code>disk0</code> and it will take us directly inside Windows 11.</p> <p>Another problem that may arise here is that, if you try to shutdown the windows it will not shutdown the system and will just log you out from the windows. This issue could be related to the Fast Startup feature in Windows, which sometimes causes problems in dual-boot setups. Fast Startup is a hybrid shutdown feature that saves the state of the operating system to a hibernation file.  </p> <p></p> <p>Finally, let's fix the last step and that is to add a boot entry for windows 11 in the GRUB bootloader. 1. Boot into Parrot OS. 2. Mount nvme1n1p3 to the /mnt directory of ParrotOS. 3. Add a Custom GRUB Entry</p> <p></p> <p>For this case study, it should be:</p> <p></p> <p>That's it, execute sudo reboot to see the below holy screen.  </p>"},{"location":"school/tiers/os/#installing-amd-gpu-graphics-drivers","title":"Installing AMD GPU Graphics drivers","text":"<ol> <li>Install the drivers from <code>install-amdgpu</code> binary.</li> <li>Make sure the deb URL contains the <code>jammy</code> mirror.</li> </ol> <pre><code>cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/amdgpu.list\ndeb https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu/6.1.3/ubuntu jammy main\n#deb-src https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu/6.1.3/ubuntu jammy main\n</code></pre> <ol> <li><code>sudo amdgpu-install --usecase=graphics,opencl --vulkan=amdvlk,pro</code></li> <li><code>sudo lshw -C display</code></li> </ol>"},{"location":"school/tiers/services/","title":"Services","text":""},{"location":"school/tiers/services/#principles","title":"Principles","text":"No. Principle <code>1</code> There is more than meets the eye.

Examine the below code carefully, when the private method <code>_onDown()</code> is called on an instance of <code>Cars</code> class, the event listener is not getting removed. Can you guess why? <pre><code>class Cars {\n    constructor(engine, opts) {\n        this._engine = engine;\n        this._opts = opts;\n    }\n\n    init() {\n        this._privateMethod();\n    }\n\n    #################### Private methods ##############################\n\n    _privateMethod() {\n        // Doing something that is only requierd by an instance of this class.\n    }\n\n    _bind() {\n        certificate.register((e) =&gt; {\n            if (!onClick)\n                document.addEventListener('mousedown', this._onDown);\n\n            if (onClick) {\n                document.removeEventListener('mousedown', this._onDown);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    _onDown() {\n        console.log(this._onDown); // Prints 'undefined' in the console.\n        document.removeEventListener('mousedown', this._onDown);\n    }\n\n    #################### Public methods ##############################\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>If <code>console.log(this._onDown)</code> returns <code>undefined</code>, it suggests that the <code>_onDown</code> function is not bound to the current object instance correctly, or it might not be defined in the context where you expect it to be. In JavaScript, the value of this inside a function depends on how the function is called. If the function is called as a method of an object (e.g., object.method()), then this refers to the object itself. Otherwise, in functions called without a context, this typically refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or undefined (in strict mode).</p> <p>To ensure that <code>_onDown</code> is properly bound to the correct this, you might need to use arrow functions or explicitly bind the function to a specific context.</p> <p>Solution-A You can explicitly bind the function to a specific context. In this example, _onDown is explicitly bound to the current object instance within the constructor function using the bind() method. This ensures that this inside _onDown refers to the correct object instance.</p> <pre><code>class Cars {\n    constructor(engine, opts) {\n        this._onDown = this._onDown.bind(this);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Solution-B Alternatively, you can use arrow functions. With arrow functions, this lexically refers to the enclosing context, which means it retains the value of this from the surrounding code.</p> <pre><code>class Cars {\n    _onDown = () =&gt; {\n        document.removeEventListener('mousedown', this._onDown);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Example 2: Objects in JavaScript This works but how is that possible? s[method] is s.setDev, if method = 'setDev' so where is that . coming from?</p> <pre><code>modules.forEach((m) =&gt; {\n    if (m !== this._module) {\n        let opts = { moduleType: value };\n        let method = '';\n\n        if (m.getType() === 'web') {\n            method = 'setDev';\n        } else if (m.getType() === 'security') {\n            method = 'setMalware';\n        }\n\n        return s[method](opts);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre> <p>You're correct to question that. In JavaScript, when you use square brackets ([]) to access a property of an object, you can use a variable to specify the property name dynamically. For example, if you have an object <code>obj</code> and you want to access its property <code>prop</code>, you can use <code>obj[prop]</code>. If prop has a value of 'foo', then <code>obj[prop]</code> is equivalent to <code>obj.foo</code>. In your case, <code>s[method]</code> is equivalent to <code>s['setDev']</code>, and because method is 'setDev', it resolves to <code>s.setDev</code>. This feature is often used for dynamic property access or dynamic method invocation in JavaScript. It's a powerful tool for writing flexible and concise code.</p>"}]}
